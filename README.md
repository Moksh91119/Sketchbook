# ðŸ“’ Sketchbook

Simple web based game engine built on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) focused on third-person character controls and related gameplay mechanics.

Mostly a playground for exploring how conventional third person gameplay mechanics found in modern games work and recreating them in a general way.

## Usage

You can define your own scenes in Blender, and then read them with Sketchbook. Sketchbook needs to run on a local server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to be able to load external assets.

<!-- #### Script tag -->

1. Import:

```html
<script src="sketchbook.min.js"></script>
```

2. Load a glb scene defined in Blender:

```javascript
const world = new Sketchbook.World('scene.glb');
```


## Getting Started

1. Get the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16
2. Clone the Repository `git clone https://github.com/Moksh91119/Sketchbook.git`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Make changes and test them out at http://localhost:8080
